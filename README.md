# Interactive Photo Gallery

This is an interactive photo gallery built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The gallery is responsive, shows image details on hover, and allows viewing images in full size when clicked.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd interactive-photo-gallery
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser to view the gallery.

## Implemented Features

- Responsive photo gallery that adapts to different screen sizes.
- Hover interaction showing image details (name, location, and "know more" link).
- Modal view for displaying images in full size with details.

## Coding Challenges

### Challenge 1: Array Manipulation

Given an array of integers and a target sum, determine if there exists a contiguous subarray within the array that sums up to the target.

#### Solution
The solution uses a sliding window approach to find a contiguous subarray that sums up to the target.

### Challenge 2: String Transformation

Given a string, transform it based on the following rules:
- If the length of the string is divisible by 3, reverse the entire string.
- If the length of the string is divisible by 5, replace each character with its ASCII code.
- If the length of the string is divisible by both 3 and 5 (i.e., divisible by 15), perform both operations in the order specified above.

#### Solution
The solution involves checking the length of the string and applying the respective transformations based on the rules.

## Directory Structure

- `index.html`: Main HTML file.
- `styles.css`: CSS for styling the gallery.
- `script.js`: JavaScript for gallery functionality.
- `images/`: Directory containing the images for the gallery.
- `Challenges/arrayMap.js`: Solution for the array manipulation challenge.
- `Challenges/stringTransform.js`: Solution for the string transformation challenge.
